# Before you download the source
I have copied some of the code from a few sources including
 + The Cherno Project's Game programming series
 + CRAZEERUSKEE for the tinting features
 + And in don't remember but the CSV map reader some of it wasn't mine :(

anyway the game is in the building faze and is no REAK GAME is it just a engine right now
but i do plan to make a real usable game engine out of this and make the end-game in it
but for now this is what i have :)

## Healm
A small game built in java from scratch

the change the map to the real spawn:

1, goto the Game.java file
2, locate the line of code "mapTest = new Map("res/maps/blank.csv");"
3, change "blank" to "spawn"
